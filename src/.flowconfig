# The following two lines map '@lib' to 'src/lib' and '@lib/$x' to 'src/lib/$x'.
# This makes it possible to require the lib modules like this:
# const lib = require('@lib');
# Or like this: (assuming lib exports a logger):
# const { logger } = require('@lib');
# You can add more mapped directories here but you have to make sure to also
# adjust your .babelrc.js file accordingly. Please refer to the documentation.
